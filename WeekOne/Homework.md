# Homework 1
This assignment is going to give you practice with a basic git workflow. You are encouraged to refer to the slides and lecture video for any guidance (please do this *before* coming to office hours). If you are stuck, we are here for you in office hours or you can post to the Piazza.

For this week's assignment, you will be modifying the `HelloWorld.py` Python file to add a few simple lines of code. This might seem daunting, especially if you have never used Python before, but don't worry - the code you'll have to write this week will be very basic.

1. When you open `HelloWorld.py`, there is currently a single line of code printing a "Hello World" statement. Below that line, you will add two more print statements. First, you will print "My name is: [YOUR NAME HERE]". After that, print out your netid. If done correctly, then the program's output will look like this:
```
Hello World   
My name is: John Smith   
jsmith2
```
2. Verify that your code works properly by running it, either through your command line by running "python HelloWorld.py" if you have python installed, or through an online Python compiler, like [this one](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/). It's good practice to check your code works before making a commit.

3. Once your code works, commit it and push it back to your github repo. Make sure you leave a descriptive commit message! (Again, it's good practice to do so) You will be graded on how well you followed standard git practices, including leaving detailed commit messages, as well as successfully cloning your repo onto your computer and pushing the updated version back to github. See `Rubric.md` for more.
